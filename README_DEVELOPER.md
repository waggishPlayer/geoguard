# 🌍 GeoGuard Developer Documentation

**GeoGuard** is a comprehensive mine safety and monitoring system designed to predict and visualize geological risks in real-time. This repository contains both the Python-based backend logic and the React Native mobile application.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. Mobile Application (`/mobile-app`)
The core user interface, built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It has been engineered to run **independently** (offline-capable) by porting the risk logic to JavaScript.

*   **`src/screens/`**: UI Screens (Map, Climate, Prediction, Report, Evacuation).
*   **`src/services/RiskEngine.js`**: 🧠 **CORE LOGIC**. This service calculates risk locally on the device. It fetches weather, simulates sensors, and generates the risk grid.
*   **`src/services/api.js`**: Interface for data fetching. Currently points to `RiskEngine` for local execution.
*   **`src/components/`**: Reusable UI components (StatusBadge, etc.).

### 2. Backend & Research (`/src`)
The original research code, Python backend, and ML models. Useful for the backend developer to understand the algorithms before they were ported to mobile.

*   **`api/main.py`**: FastAPI server (originally used to serve data).
*   **`backend/fusion_engine.py`**: 🧠 **PYTHON CORE**. The original risk calculation logic. `RiskEngine.js` is a port of this.
*   **`geo/climate_module.py`**: Weather data handling (OpenWeatherMap integration).
*   **`sim/sensor_stream.py`**: Python script for generating synthetic sensor data streams.
*   **`ml/`**: Machine learning models for vision-based crack detection.

## 📊 Data Sources & Generation

### 1. Weather Data (Real) ☁️
*   **Source**: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/).
*   **Implementation**:
    *   **Mobile**: `RiskEngine.js` calls the API directly.
    *   **Fallback**: If offline, it generates synthetic weather data (randomized within realistic bounds).
*   **Key**: `d35fba280190f0e95977742016f32cb4` (Free tier).

### 2. Sensor Data (Synthetic) 📡
*   **Source**: Simulated locally.
*   **Logic**:
    *   We simulate 5 sensor nodes (`S0` to `S4`) placed around the mine.
    *   **Metrics**:
        *   `disp_mm` (Displacement): Random noise + trends.
        *   `pore_kpa` (Pore Pressure): Base value + random fluctuation.
        *   `vibration_g` (Vibration): Random spikes.
*   **File**: `RiskEngine.js` (function `generateSensors`).

### 3. Geological Data (Synthetic) 🪨
*   **Source**: Static zoning logic.
*   **Logic**: The map is divided into a 20x20 grid.
    *   **Mine Center**: High base risk (active excavation).
    *   **NW Zone**: Unstable rock formation (+35% risk).
    *   **SE Zone**: Slope area (+30% risk).
    *   **Noise**: Gaussian noise added for realism.

## 🧠 Risk Models & Algorithms

### The "Fusion Engine" (Risk Calculation)
The risk score (0.0 to 1.0) for each grid cell is calculated using a weighted formula:

$$
\text{Base Risk} = (0.45 \times \text{Mine Proximity}) + (0.35 \times \text{Geology}) + (0.20 \times \text{Sensors})
$$

1.  **Mine Proximity**: Exponential decay from the center ($0.85 \times e^{-dist}$).
2.  **Geology**: Static zones defined by grid coordinates.
3.  **Sensors**: Inverse distance weighting (IDW) from the 5 sensor nodes.

**Final Score**:
$$
\text{Final Risk} = \text{Base Risk} \times \text{Weather Multiplier}
$$
*   **Weather Multiplier**: Increases based on rainfall (24h/72h) and intensity.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Mobile App (Frontend)
1.  Navigate to the folder:
    ```bash
    cd mobile-app
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run on Simulator/Device:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
4.  **Build APK**:
    ```bash
    eas build --platform android --profile release --local
    ```

### Backend (Python - Optional/Reference)
If you want to run the original Python server:
1.  Navigate to root:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
2.  Install requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run server:
    ```bash
    python src/api/main.py
    ```

## 📝 Notes for Developers

*   **Frontend Dev**: Focus on `mobile-app/`. The app is currently **independent**. If you want to connect to a real backend later, update `src/services/api.js` to point to a server URL instead of `RiskEngine`.
*   **Backend Dev**: The logic in `fusion_engine.py` is the source of truth for the algorithm. If you update the risk model, ensure `mobile-app/src/services/RiskEngine.js` is updated to match (or switch the app to consume your API).
